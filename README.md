bash-prompt.sh
===========

Because it's the future and we have color screens and fast processors. I will not waste time and effort  

 - wondering what machine I'm on
 - what user i am
 - what my current path is
 - whether the last command was successful
 - what git branch I'm on
 - what AWS account I'm currently controlling
 - what time I did that thing
 - what command number I'm on.

I should be able to see things things at a glance, w/o touching the keyboard, with visual feedback for important stuff like root logins or prod servers or non-zero return codes.
